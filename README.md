# react-isomorphic-data monorepo
Easily fetch data from a GET request in your React components, with similar APIs to [react-apollo](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/) 🎉

*NOTE: This project is still very much work in progress, use at your own risk ⚠️*

**The main package is in [`./packages/react-isomorphic-data`](./packages/react-isomorphic-data)**

### Trying it out
```
# install dependencies
yarn install

# run the SSR example
yarn example:ssr
```

The example (a [razzle](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle) app) by default will run on localhost:3000 🎉
